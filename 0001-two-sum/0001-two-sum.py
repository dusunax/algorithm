# 1. Two Sum

- use a hash map to store the numbers and their indices.
- iterate through the list and check if the complement of the current number (target - nums[i]) is in the hash map.
- if it is, return the indices of the two numbers.
- if it is not, add the current number and its index to the hash map.

## Time and Space Complexity

```
TC: O(n)
SC: O(n)
```

#### TC is O(n):
- iterating through the list just once to find the two numbers. = O(n)

#### SC is O(n):
- using a hash map to store the numbers and their indices. = O(n)
